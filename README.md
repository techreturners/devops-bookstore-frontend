# DevOps Bookstore

A sample [React](https://reactjs.org/) app and accompanying Dockerfile for publishing the built app to [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/)


## Instructions

### Fork and Clone

Firstly make sure you [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) to your own GitHub account and the clone your forked version down to your local computer.

###¬†Exploring the files üïµÔ∏è

Before diving in to getting things running, it's well worth exploring the structure and files within this repository.

Let's start with the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile). Notice that it contains information around the [Parent Image](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/#parent-image). You can see this twice in the file indicated by the lines `FROM node:13.12.0-alpine as build` and `FROM nginx:1.21.0-alpine`.

Usually you would only see one parent image for a Dockerfile. However, this particular Dockerfile is a little bit more interesting. It actually contains the definition for two different docker images, one to **build** the React application and one for **running** the built application. This is because we use [multi-stage build concept](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) with Docker.

Within the [src](./src) directory you'll find the Javascript files for the React application.

### Running in Docker

The application can be deployed as a Docker container.

In order to run in docker firstly build the docker image.

It will utilse the Docker [multi-stage build concept](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/). Firstly utilising a node image to build the react app. Then it will take the output of that build phase and place it into an [Nginx image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) and run as a webserver.

```
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t bookstore-frontend:1.0 .
```

Once the image has built you can start up the container by running:

```
docker run --platform linux/amd64 --rm -it -p 8080:80 bookstore-frontend:1.0
```

Then you should be able to open up your browser and head to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

### (Optional) Running Locally

If you would like to run the application locally (without Docker) you'll need [Node and NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#overview) installed. 

It also assumes that you have the backend REST API running locally on port 3000.

To run the application locally you can run:

```
npm install
```

Followed by:

```
npm start
```

## FAQ

#### When I run npm install it completes but shows vulernabilities, is this a problem?

Javascript packages can sometimes have vulnerabilities in them and if the versions (in the package.json) aren't updated then NPM highlights those vulnerabilities. For the purpose of this exercise you can ignore them, in production you would would to address them and update the versions.
